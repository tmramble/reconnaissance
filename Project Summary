### **Project Title: Risk Assessment of Cloud Web Database Application for CyberSec Cloud Enterprises**

---

#### **Summary:**
This project involved conducting a comprehensive risk assessment of a Cloud Web Database Application for CyberSec Cloud Enterprises as part of the COP 610 coursework. The focus was on identifying and analyzing potential threats, vulnerabilities, and risks to the information system using the guidelines outlined in NIST SP 800-30. The assessment included categorizing risks, determining their likelihood and impact, and providing mitigation strategies to reduce the potential adverse effects on organizational operations and assets.

#### **Key Contributions and Systems Used:**

- **Conducted a Tier 3 Risk Assessment**:
  - **System**: CyberSec Cloud Enterprises' Cloud Web Database Application.
  - Evaluated risks at the information system level, focusing on incomplete or inadequate implementation of NIST SP 800-53 controls.

- **Identified and Analyzed Threat Sources**:
  - **System**: NIST SP 800-30 framework.
  - Classified threats into technological, physical/environmental, and organizational/people categories.

- **Applied Assessment Scales for Likelihood, Impact, and Risk**:
  - **System**: NIST SP 800-30 framework.
  - Utilized qualitative and semi-quantitative values to determine the likelihood of threat events, their potential impact, and the overall risk level.

- **Mitigated Risks Through Control Implementation**:
  - **System**: NIST SP 800-53 controls.
  - Provided mitigation strategies and controls, such as backup generators for power outages, to reduce the likelihood and impact of risks.

- **Performed Reconnaissance and Network Discovery**:
  - **Tools**: Zenmap, OWASP.
  - Conducted reconnaissance of the target website, identifying potential vulnerabilities, open ports, and operating systems.

- **Analyzed Network Topology and OSI Model**:
  - **Tools**: Fisheye Topology Map, Zenmap.
  - Interpreted network scan results, analyzed the OSI model, and differentiated between UDP and TCP protocols.

- **Ethical Hacking and Zero Trust Architecture**:
  - **Framework**: EC-Councilâ€™s 5 stages of ethical hacking.
  - Discussed the importance of NDAs, ethical hacking techniques, and the principles of zero-trust architecture.

#### **Summary Bullet Points:**

- Conducted a comprehensive Tier 3 risk assessment of a Cloud Web Database Application using NIST SP 800-30 guidelines, identifying critical vulnerabilities and risks.
- Utilized NIST SP 800-53 controls to develop and implement mitigation strategies, reducing the likelihood and impact of identified risks.
- Employed Zenmap for network discovery and OWASP tools for vulnerability assessment, leading to the identification of open ports and system vulnerabilities.
- Analyzed network topology using Fisheye Topology Map and interpreted scan results to determine the accuracy of operating system identification.
- Differentiated between UDP and TCP protocols and evaluated the OSI model for secure network communication.
- Applied ethical hacking principles, including reconnaissance and zero-trust architecture, to enhance security measures and protect organizational assets.
